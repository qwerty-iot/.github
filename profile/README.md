## About me
I am an experienced technology development and engineering executive with proven success in the Internet of Things (IoT).  I've built solutions for many industries such as factory automation, telematics, healthcare, smart metering, condition-based monitoring, and asset tracking.

Prior to Tartabit, I was the CTO at Telit, a leading provider of IoT hardware, software, and services.  At Telit and ILS Technology I created the deviecWISE family of IIoT integration products facilitating easy integration of "things" to the business systems that companies rely on.
